BROKEN 
----
i think refresh timer is weird
enironment stat card is SO fucked
dnd_b imports show their hp from time of import and then auto refresh to the current amount - fix is hit a refresh on page load to make sure its up to date

FIXED
----
on enemy show do not auto refresh unless you have dnd_beyond enemies
when bad guys are in list, play is available even if not saved or no name
on autorefresh dmb when no dnd_b avatar gets bugged because I dont set a default
saving new encounter on refresh? which freezes and crashes stuff
Same creatures share hp no for some reason when damaging and healing
dnd_b imports reset to their SAVED LOCAL hp when any other saved local thing is updated, need to save new data to local when refresh
DMB player hp doesnt change when updated

Auto init somes doesnt sort right, i think this is when its the same creature but not sure
dummys dont get initiative, neither do environment but for different reason
when a creature is not available on dnd beyond they have 0/0 hp which makes them  have a skull
player override hp is not calculated in refresh
Good guys dont properly reload their HP when the refresh all button is clicked - works for good buy refresh
All icons dont reload their dead overlay when refresh buttons are clicked - current workaround, reload page
combat timer - stop/start? quick options 30 seconds - 1 min 2 min 5 min
click character -> conditiions bar shows up with all conditions, bright ones are active dim ones are inactive, click to select/deselect
add toggle to not show dead guys
refresh on reveal
add death saves
add auto refresh 5 minutes or so
added youtube video link upload for backgrounds
