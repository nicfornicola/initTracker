DONE - offline mode
------
when editing from encounter, overwriting image color and such is saved to the client homebrew list but is not saved to database 
when editing +init, roll init gets the string value instead of number from it i.e. '7+10'
Swim 0 shows in statblock when edited
0 shows in the legendary action tracker spot when homebrewed
create from template (homebrew button next to + button) to the templates statblocks
create from scratch from homebrew tab (+ button) to open an empty statblock
dndbeyond imported folder per user

add button to resize images and add 
add x button to remove uploadedLinks and images
make currentplayerviewimage reference the data to save on space
dnd_b imports show their hp from time of import and then auto refresh to the current amount - fix is hit a refresh on page load to make sure its up to date 
actions and stuff is not loading from database correctly
make table for images
connect to DM instead of connecting to encounter, that way when the dm changes encounter the playerview would "follow" by changing backgrounds... not sure how this would work tho

fix problem with scrolling adding more then it needs to and spamming api calls 
when removing a monster it selects it
fix default image - get first word in type instead of whole thing :)
add dummy under encounter list 
add environment token under encounter list 


FIXED
----
initative entrys sometimes reset/arent auto sorting
on enemy show do not auto refresh unless you have dnd_beyond enemies
when bad guys are in list, play is available even if not saved or no name
on autorefresh dmb when no dnd_b avatar gets bugged because I dont set a default
saving new encounter on refresh? which freezes and crashes stuff
Same creatures share hp no for some reason when damaging and healing
dnd_b imports reset to their SAVED LOCAL hp when any other saved local thing is updated, need to save new data to local when refresh
DMB player hp doesnt change when updated

Auto init somes doesnt sort right, i think this is when its the same creature but not sure
dummys dont get initiative, neither do environment but for different reason
when a creature is not available on dnd beyond they have 0/0 hp which makes them  have a skull
player override hp is not calculated in refresh
Good guys dont properly reload their HP when the refresh all button is clicked - works for good buy refresh
All icons dont reload their dead overlay when refresh buttons are clicked - current workaround, reload page
combat timer - stop/start? quick options 30 seconds - 1 min 2 min 5 min
click character -> conditiions bar shows up with all conditions, bright ones are active dim ones are inactive, click to select/deselect
add toggle to not show dead guys
refresh on reveal
add death saves
add auto refresh 5 minutes or so
added youtube video link upload for backgrounds
