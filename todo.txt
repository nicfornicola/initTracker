FIXED
----
Auto init somes doesnt sort right, i think this is when its the same creature but not sure
dummys dont get initiative, neither do environment but for different reason
when a creature is not available on dnd beyond they have 0/0 hp which makes them  have a skull
player override hp is not calculated in refresh
Good guys dont properly reload their HP when the refresh all button is clicked - works for good buy refresh
All icons dont reload their dead overlay when refresh buttons are clicked - current workaround, reload page
combat timer - stop/start? quick options 30 seconds - 1 min 2 min 5 min
click character -> conditiions bar shows up with all conditions, bright ones are active dim ones are inactive, click to select/deselect
add toggle to not show dead guys
refresh on reveal
add death saves
add auto refresh 5 minutes or so
added youtube video link upload for backgrounds
